This project uses:
* spring-boot
* spring-mvc
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

**Consider**: The status update is currently done by constantly polling the server and the response is very basic by sending 
everything on each request.

**Disclaimer**: Please only use this as a starting point for your own research, don't just copy/paste :).
